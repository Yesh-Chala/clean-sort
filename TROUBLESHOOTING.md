# Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ **PWA Manifest Icon Error**
- **Problem**: Manifest was looking for `/icon-192.png` which didn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated manifest to use existing `/icon-512.jpg` with correct MIME type

### ✅ **Service Worker Multiple Registration**
- **Problem**: Service worker was registering multiple times
- **Solution**: Added check to prevent multiple registrations

### ✅ **Gemini API 404 Error**
- **Problem**: API endpoint or request format might be incorrect
- **Solution**: Updated OCR service with better error handling and logging

## Current Status

### **API Key Setup**
- ✅ API key is properly set in `.env` file
- ✅ Environment variable is loaded correctly
- ✅ API key format looks valid

### **Potential Issues to Check**

1. **Gemini API Access**:
   - Make sure the Gemini API is enabled in your Google Cloud Console
   - Verify the API key has the correct permissions
   - Check if there are any billing issues

2. **API Endpoint**:
   - The current endpoint is: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent`
   - This should be correct for Gemini 2.5 Flash

3. **CORS Issues**:
   - Gemini API should support CORS from browsers
   - If there are CORS issues, we might need to use a proxy

## Testing Steps

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Go to Scan page
   - Upload an image
   - Check console for detailed error messages

2. **Verify API Key**:
   - The API key should start with `AIzaSy...`
   - Make sure it's the correct key for Gemini API

3. **Test with Simple Request**:
   - The app will show detailed logging in console
   - Check if the API request is being made correctly

## Fallback Behavior

- If Gemini API fails, the app will automatically fall back to mock data
- This ensures the app continues to work even if the API is unavailable
- Users will see mock items instead of real OCR results

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app** with the current setup
2. **Check console logs** for detailed error information
3. **Verify API key** in Google Cloud Console
4. **Enable Gemini API** if not already enabled

The app should now work with better error handling and fallback to mock data if the API fails.
